Player vs Neural Network
    Done * Build 3x3 grid first(In div), display: grid
    Done * Create 9 buttons, marks will be displayed in the button text
    Done * Lines will be the borders of the buttons
    * There should be a database for click coordination so that the place clicked will be recorded once, touch move.
        - There should be a state and neural's output, example: [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1], 1 is X and -1 is O
        - The Network should search for availables moves/action as other moves will surely be not available due to the action is been occupied by the opponent already, in other words, if the opponent is X and you are O, there is a better possibility that the space has been occupied in the grid, so there could be an ignore of execution and move on to the next available move.
    * Database must have coordinates of combinations of X and O for pattern referencing, not sure again if the database must get other X and Os in the platform, 
        or only the triple winner combo.
    * Neural network's reinforcement learning will be based on the existing moves by the player, depending also if who wins.
        - The very first execution of the neural network, if no starting data in it's memory/data, all inputs will be randomized. This will be the initialization.
            - As a follow up for this, if a new state exists, the next input will be randomized as well as because there is no record of play that won during that state recorded by the AI which is the neural network itself.
        - If the neural network wins, no learning, but if the neural network loses, it will learn, but there should be existing combos for this and there should be path for it's learning.
            - If this combo have been played in it's record
        - Winning combo of the won player will be recorded and will be evaluated in the neural network's play combo for that matching combo, I know this will be messy and confusing because a certain scenario/combo will have possible other options to play, so I need to think ways to do this without confusing my AI.

    * I think, at first, they will have random values, but over time, they will learn at each other's randomness if what's effective, learning through who wins
